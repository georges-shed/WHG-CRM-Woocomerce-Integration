* Attach tags and/or workflows to the contact.
* Syncs **All WordPress Users** to GHL CRM by admin.

== 🚀 GHL Contacts ==

When someone signs up or makes a purchase, it automatically creates a new contact for them in your GHL system. For instance, John's WordPress registration adds a "John" contact in GHL.

== 🚀 Tags and Workflows ==

New website sign-ups or purchases create GHL contacts (e.g., John registers = John's GHL contact). Tags (e.g., "New Customer") and workflows (e.g., welcome email) can be assigned.

== 🚀 Keep Your CRM Data Up-to-Date ==
All WordPress user data can be seamlessly migrated to GoHighLevel (GHL) as contacts. This ensures a synchronized database, where existing GHL contacts are automatically updated with any changes in WordPress, and new users are added as fresh contacts.

== 🚀 Multi-Account GHL Access
Select and Connect GHL accounts as per your need.
